# Sunday_Sunday_Sunday

## Purpose

The goal of this program is to take in two dates and retrieve the number of Sundays that fell on the first of the month within that range. That's a lot of Monster Truck Rallies! "You'll pay for the whole seat, BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE EDGE!!!!"  Sorry, just reminiscing about those radio ads.


## Getting Started

I've created two Ruby programs and one RSpec test file.  To run via the command line, type 'ruby counting_sundays.rb' or 'ruby counting_sundays_command_line.rb' (for the more user-friendly program)

To run the rspec tests, type 'rspec counting_sundays_spec.rb'.

Enjoy
